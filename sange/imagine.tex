\begin{vers}
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace...
\end{vers}

\begin{vers}
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one
